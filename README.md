# Demo Nodetron

![Test](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron/workflows/Test/badge.svg?event=push)

A nodeJS tron for the `demo` platform.

Nodetron is compatible with the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer).

It can be deployed with a similar configuration, and can participate in a tron chain with other trons like itself or other languages.
The simulator can also be used to drive traffic to Nodetron.

### Behaviors

Nodetron supports the below behaviors. For more information, see the [Behavior Documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer/tree/main/documentation/developer/behaviors)

* Throw
* Compute
* Memory Allocation

### Requirement

When hosting on a physical host or VM (not serverless/lambda), nodetron requires at least 800MB of memory.
When deployed with the deployer, a `memmon` watchdog process ensures the process is recycled if the memory consumption exceed this threshold.

### Configuration

The Nodetron configuration is located in a json configuration file, typically stored under the /config folder. It is similar the the other tron config structure. Here is an example showing 2 app dependencies:

```json
{
  "id": "nodetron2",
  "port": 3002,
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "id":"app2",
      "urls":["http://localhost:5002"]
    },
    {
      "id":"app3",
      "urls":["http://localhost:5003"]
    }
  ]
}
```


#### Demo-Deployer

Nodetron can be also be deployed with the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer), and supports Logging and Logging in Context.
Nodetron can also be instrumented with browser, using the same nodejs agent definition.
Here is a deployer config example:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "node1",
      "destinations": ["host1"],
      "display_name": "Nodetron",
      "source_repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron.git",
      "deploy_script_path": "/deploy/linux/roles",
      "port": 3002,
      "params": {
        "delay_start_ms": 5000,
        "database_user": "testuser",
        "database_password": "<password here>",
        "database_host": "127.0.0.1",
        "database_port": 5000
      }
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "id": "host1",
      "provider": "aws",
      "type": "ec2",
      "size": "t2.micro"
    }
  ],
  "instrumentations": {
    "services":[
      {
        "id": "nr_node_agent",
        "service_ids": ["node1"],
        "provider": "newrelic",
        "source_repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git",
        "deploy_script_path": "deploy/node/linux/roles",
        "version": "6.4.1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Params
* delay_start_ms can be used to delay the time the service starts by this amount in milliseconds. During that interval, any incoming http request will error.
* database_user is used when connecting to a database. It defines the user to connect as.
* database_password is used when connecting to a database. It defines the password to use when connecting as the user denoted in the `database_user` field.
* database_host is used when connecting to a database. Its value should be the IP address of the database.
* database_port is used when connecting to a database. Its value should be the port that the database is listening on.

### Docker support

Nodetron can be run in docker. A dockerfile is available at the root, you can use the commands below to build the image, run the test and run nodetron itself with the default config example

```
docker build -t nodetron .
docker run -it --entrypoint npm nodetron test
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 nodetron
```

### Cron jobs support

Cron jobs can be registered upon deployment using the demo-deployer Files configuration for the service. Here is an example for restarting a `node1` service every hour, at the 0 minute.

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "node1",
      "display_name": "Node1",
      "source_repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/demo-nodetron.git",
      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/linux/roles",
      "port": 5001,
      "destinations": ["host"],
      "files": [
        {
          "destination_filepath": "engine/cronjob.json",
          "content": [
              {
                  "frequency": "0 * * * *",
                  "job": "/usr/bin/supervisorctl restart node1",
                  "root": true
              }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
